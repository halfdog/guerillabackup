    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>This is the manual page for the <command>TransferService</command>
      command. For more details see packaged documentation at
      /usr/share/doc/guerillabackup. The service has two main
      purposes: providing a stream-based protocol for interaction
      with other TransferService instances and application of
      storage and retrieval policies for data synchronization.</para>
    <para>The network part uses a local (AF_UNIX) socket to listen
    for incoming connections (see /var/run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket
    below). There is no authentication magic or likely-to-be-flawed
    custom-made crypto included in that part: any process allowed
    to open the socket can talk the protocol. For connectivity
    and authentication, use your favorite (trusted) tools. Good
    starting points are socat with OPENSSL X509 client/server
    certificate checks on one side and 
    UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket for the
    other one. When using SSH to forward such connections, you
    should consider key-based authentication with command forcing
    (command="/usr/bin/socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket")
    and default security options (restrict).</para>

    <para>The policies are the other domain of the TransferService.
    They define the authorization rules granting access to backup
    data elements but do NOT grant access to the remote file system
    as such or allow creation or restore of backups. That is the
    domain of BackupGenerator tool. The policy also defines, which
    backup elements should be copied or moved to other storages.
    Each TransferService may have two polices: one defining, what
    should be sent to other instances (sender policy) and what
    should be received (receiver policy). Without defining a policy
    for a transfer direction, no data will be sent in that direction.
    Currently there are two predefined policies:</para>

    <para>ReceiverStoreDataTransferPolicy: this policy attempts
    to create a copy of each file offered by a remote sender and
    keeps it, even after the sender stopped providing it. This
    policy is useful to fetch all files from a remote storage.</para>

    <para>SenderMoveDataTransferPolicy: this policy offers all
    backup files in the local storage for transfer. Depending
    on the settings, files are deleted after sending or just flagged
    as sent after successful transfer.</para>

    <para>A policy implements one of the policy interfaces, that
    are ReceiverTransferPolicy and SenderTransferPolicy. You may
    create a custom policy when the predefined do not match your
    requirements.</para>

          each available parameter. The most relevant parameters
          for TransferService are TransferServiceStorageBaseDir,
          TransferReceiverPolicyClass, TransferReceiverPolicyInitArgs,
          TransferSenderPolicyClass, TransferSenderPolicyInitArgs.</para>

          <para>This is the default socket file name to connect
          two TransferService instances. The path can be changed
          by modification of "GeneralRuntimeDataDir" configuration
          property from default "/var/run/guerillabackup". By
          default, the socket is only accessible to privileged
          users and the user, who created it (mode 0600). You
          might change permissions after startup to grant access
          to other users also.</para>
