Description: resilient, distributed backup and archiving solution
 The tool supports asynchronous, local-coordinated, distributed
 secure backup generation, forwarding, verification, storage
 and deletion even in rugged environments. The system is open
 to integration of own code. The codebase is very small and
 kept simple to ease auditing.
 .
 Unlike business backup solutions, guerillabackup also considers
 following conditions that might be encountered with private use:
 * infrastructure uptime below 99%, e.g. machines not always powered
 * poor network connectivity, e.g. mobile access, parallel video
   streaming
 * poor physical access and anti-theft protection of machines
 * no security monitoring of machines
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/guerillabackup/Design.txt.gz section "Requirements"
 for more information.
