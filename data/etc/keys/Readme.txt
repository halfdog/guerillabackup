Use this directory to collect all the encryption keys required
for guerillabackup tool operation. By default, the directory is
only readable for the root user to hide the keys used by default.
Change only when you know what you are doing.

This directory is also the default home directory for Gnupg as
it does not support operation without warnings and no home directory.
